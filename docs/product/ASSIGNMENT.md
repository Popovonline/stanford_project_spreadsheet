# Assignment 2: The Clone — Build a Spreadsheet

> **Due:** Monday before Week 3 class (by 11:59pm)  
> **Points:** 0  
> **Submitting:** A text entry box or a website URL  
> **Available after:** Feb 10 at 7pm  
> **Tool:** Firebase Studio

---

Build a spreadsheet using Firebase Studio. You've probably used a spreadsheet hundreds (thousands?) of times, so you already know what it should do. The interesting part is figuring out how we get there with an AI coding partner.

**In this assignment, your job is to be strategic about which features you tackle and in what order.**

## Scope Tiers

> [!NOTE]
> This is not a grading rubric (there are no grades!). It's a way to set your own goals for the assignment. Do what you can in the time you have.

| Tier | What It Looks Like |
|------|-------------------|
| **Minimum Viable** | An editable grid with basic cell navigation and text entry. You can click a cell, type in it, and move to the next one. That's a spreadsheet at its simplest. |
| **Stretch Goals** | Working formulas (`SUM`, `AVERAGE`), column or row resizing, and basic cell formatting like bold or color. The experience starts to feel intentional. |
| **High Ceiling** | Formula bar, multi-sheet tabs, cell references across sheets, conditional formatting, CSV import/export. You went deep because you were having fun and in the flow! |

## Submission Requirements

Submit **two things:**

1. A link to your Firebase Studio project *(make sure it's set to public so we can see it)*
2. A **Loom video** (2–3 minutes) covering the four sections below

---

## Sharing Format (Your Loom Video)

> This is the same format we'll use for show-and-tell in class. Walk through these four items:

| Section | What to Cover |
|---------|---------------|
| **1. What You Built** | Show it in action. Walk us through what it does and what the goal was. |
| **2. A Pivotal Prompt** | Share one prompt that made a big difference. What did you ask for? What happened? Why was this moment important? |
| **3. What Surprised You** | Something you didn't expect, good or bad. Maybe the AI added something cool you didn't ask for. Maybe it completely misunderstood you. What did that teach you? |
| **4. What Broke & How You Fixed It** | Something went wrong (it always does). What was the bug or problem? How did you figure out what was wrong? What did you do to fix it? |

## What to Notice While Working

- When did you first find something that wasn't working the way you expected? What was it?
- Reflecting on that, do you think the issue was your prompting, the AI's interpretation, or something else entirely?
- Did you find yourself using shorter, more specific prompts over time, or longer, more detailed ones?
- Where did you spend the most time: planning, prompting, testing, or fixing?

---

## Reflection Questions

> You don't need to write answers to these, but think about them. They'll help shape your Loom video.

1. How did the gap between *"I know what a spreadsheet is"* and *"I can describe one precisely"* affect your results?
2. Did you start a new conversation at any point? What made you decide to, or not to?
3. What broke, and what did fixing it teach you about working with AI?
4. If you had to build it again, would you tackle the features in the same order? What would you change?

---

## Time Expectations

Plan for roughly **3–5 hours**, including the Loom video. You might finish sooner, or you might spend more because you're having fun. Both are fine. The interesting part isn't the spreadsheet — it's learning how you work with AI to build it. 🙂

## Where to Get Unstuck

- **Start with the grid.** Get a basic editable table working before you touch formulas or formatting. Everything else builds on top of a working grid.
- **Test one feature at a time.** After each new feature, click around and make sure nothing else broke. It's easier to fix a problem when you know exactly what change caused it.
- **Weird bugs?** Ask the AI to explain what the code is doing before asking it to fix anything.
- **Going in circles?** Start a new chat. Sometimes a fresh conversation works better than a long one.
